## Blueprints Overview

### 1. **Lokalise Task Webhook Listener**

   This blueprint listens for webhook notifications from Lokalise and updates your Notion dashboard whenever a task status or language status updates.
   - **Task Created**
   - **Task Queued**
   - **Task Closed**
   - **Language Closed**

   This setup keeps your Notion dashboard synchronized with task events in Lokalise.

### 2. **Scheduled Task Progress Updater**

   This blueprint runs on a schedule that you set in Make.com. It checks the status of ongoing tasks in Lokalise and updates the Notion dashboard accordingly. The frequency of updates is fully customizable using Make.comâ€™s scheduling options.
